        <h2 id="para">Calisthenics is a form of exercise that uses your own body weight as resistance to build strength, flexibility, and endurance. Unlike traditional weightlifting, calisthenics requires minimal equipment and focuses on natural movements such as push-ups, pull-ups, squats, and dips. These exercises can be performed almost anywhere, making calisthenics accessible and versatile. Over time, practitioners develop greater control over their bodies, improve their balance, and can progress to advanced movements like muscle-ups, handstands, and planches. Calisthenics is popular for its ability to create functional strength and a lean, athletic physique while promoting overall body awareness and mobility.</h2>
